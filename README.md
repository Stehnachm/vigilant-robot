Checkerboard assignment for OOD at Mizzou (Updated April 17, 2018 for reflective summary)

# 1. Reflect on (think about) the work you did for the challenge. How did you do? What did you get right? What did you get wrong? What did you do differently (and possibly better) than what was posted in the solution? What was hard to do?

- The functionality of the assignment is exactly the same, though Dale's code is (of course) cleaner. For example Dale created a switch case statement for determining the size of the checkerboard within his fxml document. I created an @fxml object for each of the required dimensions.

- Dale also uses lambda expressions to continuously update and render the checkerboard with two seperate functions. Mine is condensed into one function and because of that is more messy to the eye.

# 2. How well did you understand the programming concepts and foundational knowledge needed to complete the challenge?

- At the beginning of the assignment I did not understand the concepts very well. Though through my peers and Dale's lessons I am happy to see that I ended with the same solution.

# 3. How well did you meet the requirements as set out in the challenge? What requirements did you not meet correctly (if any)?

- Met the requirements

# 4. How well does your solution match the posted solution? What is different?

- See response to number 1

# 5. How could you improve going forward? What don't you still understand that was required for the challenge?

- Cleaner code is still something I need to work on. As well as commenting my code, ha going back and looking at each function to determine what it did and how it did it was a good refresher though! I still am intrigued on how to apply created and movable objects on the anchor pane though. I know this is something we discussed in class (making a functional Checkers game)
